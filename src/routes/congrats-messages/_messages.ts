When I saw you live in the 2nd fes and bloom it only reaffirmed my thoughts that you are a great entertainer and a really cute and amazing idol. Never change how you are because that's the most special thing about you. I'll continue to support you forever. With love, a really big fan <3."

			'スバルちゃん3周年本当におめでとうございます！ 私はまだ半年ちょっとの新参スバ友です。しかし、この半年でスバルちゃんからとても多くのものを貰いました。それは私が自身の日常生活では得られない感情や発想です。 スバルちゃんがアイドルとして努力している姿、RPG プレイの感想やシナリオから得た感動、ゲームであっても諦めない姿、努力し続ける姿勢、仲間との関係など、その全ては私が自身の生活では得られない感情や発想、心の動きでした。間違いなく私は、スバルちゃんを追うことで得た心の動きや感動で圧倒的に人間として成長することができました。 スバルちゃんはいつも配信で元気をくれます。それはスバルちゃんが配信でそうなるように努力している事の1つかと思います。しかし、それ以上に多くのものをスバ友は皆スバルちゃんから貰っていると思います。それはスバルちゃんの努力や仕事に対する姿勢などから生まれていると思います。ここまで書いて分かるように、スバ友の多くは大空スバルの事を心から尊敬しています。当然私もその一人です。 心から尊敬する私の推し 大空スバル様の幸せを願って、お祝いの文章とさせていただきます。'

			'出会ったのは去年。 友達から『伝説のASMR配信』の公式切り抜きのURLを送られた事から始まりました。 初めは、この人面白いな程度に追っていました。 アイドルが好きとかでもなく、熱中するものがあまり無かった自分にとって、Vにハマる事は無いだろうと思いながら。 ただそれでも、時間がある時に配信を覗きに行ったりしていました。 気がつけば、バイト前の配信の予告ツイを見て悔しく、代わりに毎週土曜の午前10時には待機していました。ゲームや企画、コラボなど色々な配信を見ていくうちに、スバルちゃんの全力さ、というか真っ直ぐさに惹かれ、ハマっていました。 テスト勉強しながら雑談聞いたり、グッズ用の軍資金のためにバイトを頑張れたり。スバルちゃんが頑張る姿を見ると、ウジウジしてる自分が情けなくなり、もっと自分も頑張ろうと、とても元気を貰えます。自分が頑張れる原動力になっています。 言葉で表現するのが著しく下手くそなので、上手く伝わるか分かりませんが、感謝しています。  スバルちゃん。改めておめでとう。 そしてありがとう。'
